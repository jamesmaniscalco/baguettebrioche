Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

Also Zoidberg. Leela's gonna kill me. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Throw her in the brig. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? No! The cat shelter's on to me. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Large bet on myself in round one. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

You don't know how to do any of those. She also liked to shut up! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

Oh God, what have I done? Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Daylight and everything. She also liked to shut up! Bender?! You stole the atom.

I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Professor, make a woman out of me. Leela's gonna kill me. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.

You know, I was God once. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! With gusto. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. We're rescuing ya.

All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Bender, quit destroying the universe! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.
